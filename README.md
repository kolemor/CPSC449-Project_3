# Project 3

## create a venv and activate it then install the requirements

`python -m venv myenv`

`source myenv/bin/activate`

`sh ./bin/install.sh`

- NOTE: running the install command will install ALL dependencies and requirements, including aws and DynamoDB, it should also properly configure aws as well

## then in the main directory run this command to run the services

`sh run.sh`

- as a note, when running foreman for the first time, the folder structure for litefs will be created in var.

- once running, then you can create the users.db. It should be created in primary and propagated to secondary and tertiary. If not you may need to restart for it to work properly.

## Links to test the api

- Enrollment service

  `http://localhost:5000/docs`

  `http://localhost:5001/docs`

  `http://localhost:5002/docs`

- user service

  `http://localhost:5100/docs`

- KrakenD

  `http://localhost:5400/api/`

## Create the databases or restore them to their default data

`sh ./bin/db_creation.sh`

### If you want to individually create each database, you can instead run these commands from the main directory

`python enrollment/populate_enrollment.py`

`python users/populate_users.py`

- the user database population can take anywhere from 30 seconds to a couple minutes as there are ~600 users, and each one needs to have their password hashed, which takes some time. I'll see if I can optimize this later on, but for now it works

# Enrollment Service testing variables

- student_id 1 is on 3 waitlists (class_id: 8, 4, 13)
- class_id 2 (with instructor_id 2) has 4 dropped students
- class_id 4, 6, 8, 13, 14 are all full, but have open waitlists
- class_id 12 is fully enrolled, with a full waitlist
- all classes have a default max_enroll value of 30
- there are 500 student_ids, with upwards of 300 of them currently being used
- there are 100 instructor_ids, with only ~14 of them being used

- there are useful debug endpoints that you can use to view information on what is contained within the database

# Users Service testing variables

- the first user has a username of "James Smith"
- Every user's non-hashed password is the same as their username
- Users 1 - 500 have the 'student' role
- Users 501 - 600 have the 'instructor' role
- Users 551 - 600 also have the 'registrar' role

- there are useful debug endpoints that you can use to view information on what is contained within the database

# windows execution policy

- if you are running this on a windows machine you may have to set the execution policy to run your virutal enviroment

` Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process`
